      <h1>About</h1>

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Bogdan Gevko and I a Computer Science student at Oregon State University.</p>
      <h2>What is this?</h1>

      <p>
        This website was used to satisfy a final project requirement in Biology 101 at Oregon State University. It showcases a body of work that proves that I achieved course mastery. 
      </p>

      <h2>Why I chose this format</h2>
      <p>
        There are many benefits to creating a website over a traditional presentation. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>I can look back on my work in the future, which was one of the requirements for the final.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I got to improve my web development skills.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I learned a new web framework, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll.</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>This is my first website and I had a lot of fun making it.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How does this website represent mastery?</h2>
      <p>
        Each section is divided into three subsections: <em>Concepts, Skills, and Connections.</em> The uploaded images are media assignments that I completed throughout the course. The purpose of each section is to explain how each media piece meets each respective requirement.
