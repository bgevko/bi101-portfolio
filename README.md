# bi101-portfolio
This is a static site that I built for a Biology class final. The purpose of this site was to satisify the final portfolio requirement of the class, but also to gain experience in web development and create a finished product for my tech portfolio as well. 

## Frameworks used:
**Jekyll**,
**Swiper.js**,

## Features
- Swiping through slides can be done with the mouse, keyboard, dragging, or finger if on mobile. 
- Dynamic buttons that jump through different sections of the slides, and update with Javascript as the slides change
- Navigation buttons that appear at the first slide and the last slide of each section
- Dynamic information cards that provide a learning outcome for each slide.
- Responsive design that supports multiple screen sizes

## Lessons learned
- Initial experience with Jekyll
- Introduction to GitHub pages and GitHub actions
- CSS media queries and responsive design

## Things I could do better next time
- Although knowing how to manipulate the page with Javascript is really useful, I noticed that the more dynamic usage I needed, the more "hacky" the solutions became. Although I got a working product, I had to jump through hoops to piece together the front end logic. If I had to built it again, I would use React.
- Have the option to collapse the sidebar
- Consider accessibility
